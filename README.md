AtypikHouse is a platform designed for owners of unique and unusual properties, allowing them to publish their accommodations and offer them to travelers seeking distinctive experiences. Users can browse the list of available properties, check availability,
 make reservations, and process payments online for a smooth and immersive experience.

The project is built with Angular for the frontend and Symfony for the backend. Mockups and design assets are also available to showcase the user interface and experience in the Maquette directory.
